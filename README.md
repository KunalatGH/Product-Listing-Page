## Requirements

Before installing and running the Product Listing Page, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- Node.js >= 14.x
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun for package management
- Modern web browser (for viewing the application)
- (Optional) API/server endpoint if fetching dynamic product data

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Product Listing Page locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KunalatGH/Product-Listing-Page.git
    cd Product-Listing-Page
    ```
2. Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    ```packagemanagers
    {
        "commands": {
            "npm": "npm install",
            "yarn": "yarn install",
            "pnpm": "pnpm install",
            "bun": "bun install"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or specified port).

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can:

- Use the search bar to find products by keywords.
- Filter products by category, price, or other available attributes.
- Click on a product to view its details.
- Navigate through multiple pages using pagination controls.

    C -- Filter --> E[Apply filters and update grid]
    C -- Click Product --> F[Show product details]
    C -- Paginate --> G[Load next set of products]
```

## Configuration

You can customize various aspects of the Product Listing Page:

- **Data Source:** Configure the source of product data (static JSON, REST API, etc.) in the relevant configuration file or environment variable.
- **Display Settings:** Adjust columns, card styles, or grid layout via CSS or component props.
- **Filters and Sorting:** Add or modify filtering and sorting options by updating the relevant UI components and logic.
- **API Endpoints:** If integrating with an API, update the base URL and endpoints as needed.

### Example API Integration Block

If your setup uses a REST API to fetch products, an example endpoint might look like:

```api
{
    "title": "Get Product List",
    "description": "Fetches a paginated list of products with optional filters and search.",
    "method": "GET",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
    "endpoint": "/products",
    "headers": [],
    "queryParams": [
        { "key": "search", "value": "Search term", "required": false },
        { "key": "category", "value": "Product category", "required": false },
        { "key": "sort", "value": "Sort order", "required": false },
        { "key": "page", "value": "Page number", "required": false }
    ],
    "pathParams": [],
    "bodyType": "none",
    "requestBody": "",
    "formData": [],
    "responses": {
        "200": {
            "description": "List of products",
            "body": "{\n  \"products\": [...],\n  \"total\": 100\n}"
        }
    }
}
```
